# Intro to Blazor: Client Side web-apps with C# and WebAssembly

This repository contains code and slides for a talk on Blazor, given at TechExeter in September 2020.

## Talk abstract 

Blazor is Microsoft's brand new framework for building client-side web applications.
So what makes it special, compared to all the other front-end frameworks out there? 
Blazor has a unique feature: you write the code in C#, which runs in the browser using 
WebAssembly - with no Javascript involved! In this talk, we'll see how we can write 
applications using Blazor, and take a look at its syntax and component model. We'll 
explore how Blazor works under the hood, and how WebAssembly is used to run .NET 
code within the browser. We'll discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this 
approach, and get an understanding of when it makes sense to use Blazor.

### Key takeaways
* Knowledge of how to get started creating Blazor applications
* Understand how WebAssembly enables running non-Javascript languages in the browser
* Appreciate when Blazor is a good fit for an application, and when to avoid it
